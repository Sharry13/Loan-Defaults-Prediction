# Loan Default Prediction using Supervised Learning

# Overview

This project focuses on predicting loan default using various supervised learning algorithms for binary classification. The goal is to develop a robust model that accurately identifies whether a loan applicant is likely to default or not. The dataset used for training and evaluation includes relevant features such as applicant information, income, credit history, and other financial indicators.

# Problem Statement

The primary challenge addressed by this project is the need for an effective loan default prediction system. By leveraging machine learning algorithms, the objective is to build a model that aids in assessing the creditworthiness of loan applicants, ultimately reducing the risk of default for financial institutions.

# Dataset

The dataset used in this project contains a comprehensive set of features related to loan applicants, including but not limited to income, credit score, employment history, and previous financial behavior. The target variable indicates whether the applicant defaulted on the loan or not.

# Algorithms and Techniques

Multiple supervised learning algorithms are employed to train and evaluate the model. The algorithms explored include:

Logistic Regression
Decision Trees
Random Forest
Support Vector Machines (SVM)
The dataset is split into training and testing sets to ensure the model's generalization ability and performance on unseen data.

# Evaluation Metrics

The performance of the models is assessed using common binary classification metrics such as accuracy, precision, recall, and F1 score. The choice of metrics is aimed at providing a comprehensive evaluation of the model's predictive capabilities.

# Usage

Environment Setup:

Ensure the required dependencies are installed using requirements.txt.
Python version: 3.x
Data Preparation:

Obtain the dataset and place it in the designated data directory.

Model Training:

Run the training script, e.g., train_model.py, to train the machine learning models.

Model Evaluation:

Evaluate the trained models using the evaluation script, e.g., evaluate_model.py.

Inference:

Implement the trained model for loan default prediction in a production environment using the inference script, e.g., predict.py.

# Results
The project aims to achieve a well-performing model with high accuracy and precision in predicting loan defaults. The results of each algorithm, along with comparative analyses, will be detailed in the project documentation.

# Future Work
Future iterations of the project may involve:

Feature engineering for improved model performance.
Hyperparameter tuning for optimizing algorithms.
Integration of additional data sources for enhanced predictive capabilities.
